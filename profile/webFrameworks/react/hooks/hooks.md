# React hooks

ðŸ“– **Recommended reading**: [Reactjs.org - Hooks Overview](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)

React hooks allow React function style components to be able to do everything that a class style component can do and more. Additionally, as new features are added to React they are including them as hooks. This makes function style components the preferred way of doing things in React. You have already see one use of hooks to declare and update state in a function component with the `useState` hook.

```jsx
function Clicker({ initialCount }) {
  const [count, updateCount] = React.useState(initialCount);
  return <div onClick={() => updateCount(count + 1)}>Click count: {count}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<Clicker initialCount={3} />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## useEffect hook

The `useEffect` hook allows you to represent lifecycle events. For example, if you want to run a function every time the component completes rendering, you could do the following.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('rendered');
  });

  return <div>useEffectExample</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

You can also take action when the component cleans up by returning a cleanup function from the function registered with `useEffect`. In the following example, every time the component is clicked the state changes and so the component is rerendered. This causes both the cleanup function to be called in addition to the hook function. If the function was not rerendered then only the cleanup function would be called.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  const [count, updateCount] = React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('rendered');

    return function cleanup() {
      console.log('cleanup');
    };
  });

  return <div onClick={() => updateCount(count + 1)}>useEffectExample {count}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This is useful when you want to create side effects for things such as tracking when a component is displayed or hidden, or creating and disposing of resources.

## Hook dependencies

You can control what triggers a `useEffect` hook by specifying its dependencies. In the following example we have two state variables, but we only want the `useEffect` hook to be called when the component is initially called and when the first variable is clicked. To accomplish this you pass an array of dependencies as a second parameter to the `useEffect` call.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  const [count1, updateCount1] = React.useState(0);
  const [count2, updateCount2] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`count1 effect triggered ${count1}`);
  }, [count1]);

  return (
    <ol>
      <li onClick={() => updateCount1(count1 + 1)}>Item 1 - {count1}</li>
      <li onClick={() => updateCount2(count2 + 1)}>Item 2 - {count2}</li>
    </ol>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

If you specify and empty array `[]` as the hook dependency then it is only called when the component is first rendered.

Note that hooks can only be used in function style components and must be called at the top scope of the function. That means a hook cannot be called inside of a loop or conditional. This restriction ensures that hooks are always called in the same order when a component is rendered.
